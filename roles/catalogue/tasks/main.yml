#  So let's switch to the roboshop user and run the following commands.
#
#  $ curl -s -L -o /tmp/catalogue.zip "https://github.com/roboshop-devops-project/catalogue/archive/main.zip"
#  $ cd /home/roboshop
#  $ unzip /tmp/catalogue.zip
#  $ mv catalogue-main catalogue
#  $ cd /home/roboshop/catalogue
#  $ npm install
#NOTE: We need to update the IP address of MONGODB Server in systemd.service file
#  Now, lets set up the service with systemctl.
#
## mv /home/roboshop/catalogue/systemd.service /etc/systemd/system/catalogue.service
## systemctl daemon-reload
## systemctl start catalogue
## systemctl enable catalogue
